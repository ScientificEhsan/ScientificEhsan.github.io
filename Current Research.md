Mapping Resistant Mechanisms to Chemoradiotherapy and Identification of Novel Radiosensitizing Drugs for Cervical Cancer 
Last year, cervical cancer affected 600,000 individuals, leading to a mortality rate of 40% despite standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT), underscoring the grave global health challenge. Our research aims to ameliorate these treatment outcomes by focusing on validating DNA damage pathway targets and unveiling innovative radiation-sensitizing drugs for cervical cancer. To this end, we will employ CRISPR/Cas9 screening and comprehensive databases for both HPV-related and non-HPV-related cervical cancer cell lines and patient derived organoids. We will also harness the Panomics approach, utilizing single-cell resolution for DNA, RNA, and Protein, to provide a comprehensive perspective on cancer biology and personalized medicine. This strategy will illuminate essential genetic targets linked to radiation sensitivity and CRT resistance, and aid in identifying existing small molecule inhibitors for rapid clinical application. Our primary objective extends beyond merely identifying DNA damage pathway targets and novel radiation-sensitizing drugs. We also aim to construct a CRT resistance map using the steps of PHENOtypic STAte MaP (PHENOSTAMP). This map would utilize machine learning approaches on longitudinal data comprised of patients in the clinic and matched invitro organoids. This map could potentially offer predictive insights into the clinical outcome of treatment at an individualized level, thus enhancing patient outcomes. Our hypothesis posits that by targeting these pathway genes and utilizing available small molecule inhibitors, we can augment radiation sensitivity and combat CRT resistance in cervical cancer. Therefore, our mission is to provide an efficacious strategy that significantly improves the prognosis for patients battling cervical cancer. 

 

Specific Aim 1: To test DNA damage pathway genes that induce radiation sensitivity in vitro using custom CRISPR/Cas9 screening in patient-derived organoids and cervical cancer cell lines. 

 

Rationale: A comprehensive understanding of the genetic determinants of radiation sensitivity can significantly enhance therapeutic strategies and treatment outcomes for cervical cancer. By investigating both HPV-related and non-HPV related cervical cancer cell lines and patient derived organoids, we aim to unearth key genetic targets, potentially including DNA damage pathway genes or APOBEC pathway mutations. We hypothesize that DNA damage pathway genes that persist in CRT patients will result in CRT resistance in vitro. To test the hypothesis, we will conduct CRISPR/Cas9 screening in HPV-related and non-HPV cervical cancer cell lines and patient derived organoids specifically for previously identified DNA damage pathway genes associated with radiation sensitivity prioritizing the overlapped genes between in vitro screening and clinical sequencing data.  

 

Specific Aim 2: To identify clinically available small molecule inhibitors of genes associated with CRT resistance in cervical cancer patients, leveraging large-scale databases and high-throughput in vitro drug screening. 
 

Rationale: Given the relative rarity of cervical cancer, there are challenges in developing new compounds specifically for this disease. Therefore, our focus is on repurposing known or clinically available small molecule inhibitors, which will facilitate rapid translation to clinical use. We will also explore disparities between squamous cell carcinoma and cervical adenocarcinomas concerning radiation sensitivity. 

We hypothesize that clinically available small molecule inhibitors targeting genes identified in serially sequenced samples will improve radiation sensitivity. To test the hypothesis, we will utilize large-scale databases to identify all known mutations in genes that overlapped with identified mutations in our dataset (either in all HPV-related squamous cell carcinomas or across cancer types in GenBank) and use this as an input set for virtual drug screening. Furthermore, we will conduct high throughput in vitro drug screening from the NCI (National Cancer Institute) compound bank in cervical cancer cell lines to evaluate a diverse set of compounds from the NCI compound bank for their potential as radiation sensitizing agents. By successfully achieving these aims, we will have identified novel targets for rapid clinical translation and significantly improved our understanding of the biology of cervical cancer. 

 

Specific Aim 3: To develop a reference map of chemoradiation therapy resistance in cervical cancer through single-cell proteomic analyses of patient-derived 2D/3D organoids & patient samples using CyTOF (Cytometry by Time of Flight). 

 

Rationale: Acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying (CRT) resistance in cervical cancer at a single-cell resolution is essential for predicting treatment outcomes and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. By leveraging patient-derived 3D organoids and CyTOF for single-cell proteomic analyses, we aim to create a detailed reference map of CRT resistance. This strategy, based on the proof of concept shown via PHENOSTAMP and Tracer, can enable the projection of clinical data and prediction of patient treatment responses based on observed organoid treatment responses. 

We hypothesize that the generation of a single-cell proteomic reference map from patient-derived 3D organoids can capture the diverse cellular states of CRT resistance and, when combined with clinical data, can provide a predictive model for patient treatment response. 

To test this hypothesis, we will: 

Sub aim 3a. Generate patient-derived 3D organoids from cervical cancer tissue samples 		and treat them with standard CRT. 

Sub aim 3b. Conduct single-cell proteomic analyses of the treated organoids using 		CyTOF, identifying proteomic profiles associated with CRT resistance. 

Sub aim 3c. Integrate the obtained proteomic data with PHENOSTAMP and Tracer data 

to construct a comprehensive/new context specific reference map. 

Sub aim 3d. Project clinical data onto this reference map to predict/compare patient treatment responses. 

By successfully accomplishing this aim, we will generate a valuable resource for understanding and predicting CRT resistance in cervical cancer, potentially leading to improved personalized treatment strategies.
