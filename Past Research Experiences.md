 Advisor: Verónica Contreras-Shannon, Ph.D. 
    Project: Effect of pressure on Beta Tubulin isoforms in different cell types in the mouse. 
    The aim was to understand if (and how) tumors exerting pressure on adjacency tissue/structures, affects the expression of         genes related to Beta Tubulin isoforms
