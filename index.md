    <p>Hello and welcome! I’m Shafqat, a PhD candidate in Systems Biology with over three years of experience at the intersection of cancer biology and computational biology. I strive to apply high "thought" put in high-throughput experiments to test a hypothesis and bridge hands-on experimentation and computational analysis to drive oncology research. 

On the computational side, I build end-to-end pipelines that take raw sequencing reads (RNA-seq, proteomics, CyTOF) through quality control, alignment and quantification, integrate these multi-omics layers with functional genomics results, and culminate in interpretable network models. Leveraging machine-learning methods, I pinpoint biomarkers of therapeutic resistance and forecast patient response trajectories. 

Collaboration is at the heart of what I do. By partnering with wet-lab scientists, data scientists and clinicians, I ensure every computational insight generates a testable hypothesis—and every experiment yields data ripe for deeper computational mining. Now, I’m excited to bring this systems-level perspective to industry: whether you’re advancing precision-oncology platforms, identifying new drug targets or refining diagnostic pipelines, let’s connect and explore how my expertise can accelerate your next breakthrough.
    <p>One significant aspect of his research is the development of a CRT resistance map at single-cell resolution. By applying machine learning techniques to longitudinal data from patients and patient-derived organoids, Shafqat seeks to provide predictive insights into individual treatment outcomes, laying the groundwork for more personalized, precision medicine approaches in the future.</p>
