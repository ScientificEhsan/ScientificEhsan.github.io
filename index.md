    <p>Hello and welcome! I am Shafqat, a systems biologist who pours plenty of high “thought”‑put into high‑throughput experiments. I switch between pipettes and Python, pairing bench work with code so the samples—whether cultured cancer cells or fresh patient biopsies—tell their full story. </p>
    <p>I turn raw sequencing files and protein measurements into clear stories about why some tumours dodge treatment while others fold. I write the code, run the checks and build the models from the experiments</p>
    <p>If you are searching for new drug targets, refining diagnostics, or just need someone who can wrangle omics data without losing the human side of biology, let us talk.
     <p>Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about bioinformatics—or share your best throughput pun. </p>
